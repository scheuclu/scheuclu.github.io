# The Overkill calculator
The goal of this project was to implement a calculator from scratch.
Notably, I wanted to do it without the use of any sophisticated libraries.

Here's the feature specification:

 - Infix and Reverse Polish notation are supported.
 - Parentheses are supported.
 - Basic arithmatic as well as trigonometric functions are supported.
 - Supports basic constants such as Eulers number or Pi.
 - The calculator can solve for one unknown in a linear equation.
 - Proper error handling
 - Fully tested, of course.

The implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/scheuclu/OverkillCalculator).
