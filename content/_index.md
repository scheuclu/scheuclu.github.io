Hi, I am an Austrian software developer who turned from Big Tech to freelancing during the COVID pandemic.

I have an education from [Technical University of Munich]([TODO](https://www.tum.de/en/)) as well as [Stanford University]([TODO](https://www.stanford.edu/)). However, I consider myself a lifelong learner, so I have plenty or other certifications.

My favourite language is Python:heart:, but I am also fluent in C, C++ and Go.

Fields that excite me are Machine Learning, Data Visualization and Blockchain Technology.
I believe technology is about empowering people, so I value anything that brings accessibility to the masses and removes centralization.


Other than that, I am passionate about nature, fiction and Formula 1 (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±)!

Please check out my [CV](https://scheuclu.github.io/cv/) and [portfolio](https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/).

**If you think I could help you with your project, please dont hestitate to [reach out](https://scheuclu.github.io/contact/)!**
