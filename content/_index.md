Hi, I am an Austrian software developer who turned from Big Tech to freelancing during the COVID pandemic.

I have an education from [Technical University of Munich](TODO) as well as [Stanford University](TODO).

My favourite language is Python:heart:, but I am also fluent in C, C++ and Go.

Field that excite me are anything that has to do with Machine Learning, Data Visualization and Blockchain Technology.
