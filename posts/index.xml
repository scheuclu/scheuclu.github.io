&lt;p>I go through the basic concepts and mathematical formulatins and also provide a working codebase for you to try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A gallery with some of my proudest results is provided at the end :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mandelbrot images</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/mandelbrot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/mandelbrot/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post we look at the fampus mandelbrot set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I implemented it both in C++ and Python and provide some complexity considerations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I built dashboard that allows you to interactivelu explore the set and create beautiful animations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing a calculator from scratch</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/overkill_calculator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/overkill_calculator/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project came out of an interview task I once had to complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goals is to implement a fully working calculator, without using any of the standard libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The calculator is able to accept arbitrary string that represent and expression or equation and solve it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Password Hash Cracking</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/password_hash_cracking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/password_hash_cracking/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m taking a look how user-authentifications works.&lt;br>
We will dive a bit into hash functions&lt;br>
Finally, we try to recover passwords from leaked hashes using GPUs.&lt;br>
Addittionally, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide some complexity considerations as well as cost estimations.</description></item><item><title>Sudoku Solver</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/sudoko_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/sudoko_solver/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can use the Sudoku Solver whenever you are stuck on a puzzle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can read a playing field either directly via webcam or by uploading a picture and quicklu provide you with the solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I quit my job at Google</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/why_quit_google/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/why_quit_google/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post, I go over my main motivation for leaving my job at Google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting into this company was a long dream of mine, and I had worked years to get there, so the desicions was not easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am hoping that my experience will help other developers making career desicions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
