The Mandelbrot Explorer Overview The goal of this project was to implement an interactive explorer for the mandelbrot set.
It&amp;rsquo;s definition is very simple. A complex number c is considered to be in the mandelbrot set if the iteration
$$\forall c \in \mathbb{C}: \\ ~ \\ z_{0}=0 \\ z_{i+1}=z_{i}^2+c$$
converges to a stationary value. Coloring all the convergent points, gives a picture like this
If instead, the above equation diverges, we can color that point based on how fast it diverges.</description></item><item><title>Sudoku Solver</title><link>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/sudoko_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/sudoko_solver/</guid><description>Github Deployed

Note At the moment, the camera input is buggy, so you probably have to correct the results manually.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little demo of how it works.
Overview The solver consists of the following steps:
Read the image from webcam Identify the Sudoku grid using classical computer vision Dewarp the grid to rectangular format Split the rectangle into 9x9 subimages Identify the content of each subimage Brute Force a solution</description></item><item><title>Why I quit my job at Google</title><link>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/why_quit_google/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/why_quit_google/</guid><description>This blog posts describes the motivation for quitting my job at Google.
