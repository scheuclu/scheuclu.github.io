Luckily, Amazon sent me a 2-factor authentification request to confirm my login, which I promptly denied, but it got me interested in how these kind of attacks work. Now, I have been using a password manager for years (Bitwarden), but my Amazon account predates it and I guess, I was too lazy to change the password.</description></item><item><title>Neural Style Transfer</title><link>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/neural_style_transfer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/neural_style_transfer/</guid><description>Neural Style transfer In this project, I implemented neural style transfer in PyTorch.
The goals is simple. We take a content image and a style image. The goal is to keep the semantic content of the content image, but draw it in the style of the style image.
To do this, we start with a simple classification Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A CNN encodes a high resolution image into a large number of low-resolution features channels.</description></item><item><title>Mandelbrot images</title><link>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/mandelbrot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/mandelbrot/</guid><description>Github Deployed
The Mandelbrot Explorer Overview The goal of this project was to implement an interactive explorer for the mandelbrot set.
It&amp;rsquo;s definition is very simple. A complex number c is considered to be in the mandelbrot set if the iteration
$$\forall c \in \mathbb{C}: \\ ~ \\ z_{0}=0 \\ z_{i+1}=z_{i}^2+c$$
converges to a stationary value. Coloring all the convergent points, gives a picture like this
If instead, the above equation diverges, we can color that point based on how fast it diverges.</description></item><item><title>Sudoku Solver</title><link>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/sudoko_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/sudoko_solver/</guid><description>Github Deployed
Sudoku Solver You can use the Sudoku Solver whenever you are stuck on a puzzle.
I support both manual input as well as input via camera or webcam.
Note At the moment, the camera input is buggy, so you probably have to correct the results manually.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little demo of how it works.
Overview The solver consists of the following steps:
Read the image from webcam Identify the Sudoku grid using classical computer vision Dewarp the grid to rectangular format Split the rectangle into 9x9 subimages Identify the content of each subimage Brute Force a solution</description></item><item><title>Why I quit my job at Google</title><link>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/why_quit_google/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/why_quit_google/</guid><description>This blog posts describes the motivation for quitting my job at Google.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked about this many times and also have a lot of former colleagues in the same dilemma, so maybe it is of help to somebody.
