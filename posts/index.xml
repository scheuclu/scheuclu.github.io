The mandelbrot explorer Overview The goal of this project was to implement an interactive explorer for the mandelbrot set.
It&amp;rsquo;s definition is very simple. A complex number c is considered to be in the mandelbrot set if the iteration
$$\forall c \in \mathbb{C}: \\ ~ \\ z_{0}=0 \\ z_{i+1}=z_{i}^2+c$$
converges to a stationary value. Coloring all the convergent points, gives a picture like this
If instead, the above equation diverges, we can color that point based on how fast it diverges.</description></item><item><title>Implementing a calculator from scratch</title><link>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/overkill_calculator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.github.io/posts/overkill_calculator/</guid><description>Github Deployed
The Overkill calculator The goal of this project was to implement a calculator from scratch. Notably, I wanted to do it without the use of any sophisticated libraries.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the feature specification:
Infix and Reverse Polish notation are supported. Parentheses are supported. Basic arithmatic as well as trigonometric functions are supported. Supports basic constants such as Eulers number or Pi. The calculator can solve for one unknown in a linear equation.</description></item></channel></rss>
