By all means, Google is at the very top of employers. They pay well, the working hours are reasonable and there&rsquo;s plenty of perks.</p><h2 id=how-i-got-the-job>How I got the job</h2><p>I got the invite to interview at Google by completing the <a href=https://foobar.withgoogle.com/>FooBar challenge</a>.
You can be invited by searching for the right coding specific problems on Google Search.</p><p>The onsite-interview itself took one day, and honestly was a lot of fun. I was well prepared and keen on showing my skills as well as discussing my solutions with actual Google engineers.
My advice for the interview is to prepare reasonably well, and have no expectations other then gaining an interesting and valuable experience. Even if you don&rsquo;t get hired, you&rsquo;ll be able to take away a lot.</p><h2 id=why-i-took-the-job>Why I took the job</h2><p>Working at Google has always been a dream of mine.
At the time it seemed like the pinnacle of the software engineer employee life. When I got the offfer I was working at Volkwagen, but the department I had been working for was sold to Argo.AI, so it was clear I wasn&rsquo;t going to continue doing that.</p><p>Also, I felt that the beaurcacy at VW was enoromous, and I felt like hardly anything we did ever actually made it to production. My hope was that Google would be different.</p><h2 id=the-positives>The positives</h2><h3 id=professionalism>Professionalism</h3><p>From a development perspective, Google was the most professional environment I have ever seen. I learned an awful lot about best practices and proper software development on large scale. They also have highly specialized internal development tools which are perfectly integrated with each other, creating a very smooth workflow.</p><h3 id=perks>Perks</h3><p>As widely known, Google offers a wide variety of perks, including an onsite Gym, free meals all day long, baristas, play areas and even nap areas on-site.
In general the best perks are found in the US offices. Also due to the COVID lockdown, the office was closed most of the time.</p><h2 id=the-negatives>The negatives</h2><h3 id=middle-management>Middle management</h3><p>At the worst point, I had 9 manager levels above me. Especially in the mid-level mangement, nobody seemed to have any idea what their responsibilities actually are.
What is worse, a lot of energy and time was wasted in carreer fights between these managers as opposed to actually creating something.
I think the Org I joined (SRE) was worse then others, but it&rsquo;s definitly a complaint I heard a lot from other engineers.</p><h3 id=politics>Politics</h3><p>There is a lot of polictics and activism in the company. In general, wokeness is considered a must, and people who have different opinons (which always seemed to be the majority), have learned to shut up or risk retributions.
This creates a very toxic environment in the company, where the discourse is dominated by a vocal minority and political initiatives are being pushed on regular engineers all the time, who would much rather focus their energy on technical challenges.
Personally, I joined Google for to learn about tech and create fantastic products, so I never liked these distractions.</p><h3 id=lack-of-personal-development>Lack of personal development</h3><p>In my 2 years at Google, there was absolutely no room for personal development. I was used to employers actively encouraging me to work on side projects, take certifications and visit conferences.
At Google, we were always behind our product timelines and shifting priorities, and I never got any time to work on theses issues. Also engineers are considered to be code-producing machines and get no soft-skill training or chances to deveop themselves in other directions.
I think my managers where partly to blame here, but overall I have not seen much initiatives in that directions.</p><h3 id=working-in-silos>Working in silos</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a specialist for everything. The company has grown enormously over the last years, which leads to 2 distinct problems.</p><ol><li>Nobody seems to have an overview over the whole tech arm. Often there&rsquo;s multiple teams working on different solutions to the same problem without them knowing about each other. This becomes very frustrating when the inevitably find out about each other. Political fighting over whos solution wins then ensues. Worse, when it comes to internal tools, often redundant products are being brought to production.</li><li>Engineers become highly specialized. I am a life-long learner and I enjoy learning about new technologies and doing challenging work. At Google, once you&rsquo;ve found your niche, you&rsquo;re typically being asked to mostly work on this one thing. This is quite efficient from your managers point opf view, since you are creating a lot of output he/she can then use for their promotion, but it hurts you as an engineer in the long term.</li></ol><h3 id=office-locations>Office locations</h3><p>Google has great offices, but they are all in major population centers. These all have the problems of high housing prices, long commutes and unhealthy life styles.
I don&rsquo;t want my life to revolve around large cities anymore, and Google did not give me the option to work from home permanently.
