We will dive a bit into hash functions&lt;br>
Finally, we try to recover passwords from leaked hashes using GPUs.&lt;br>
Addittionally, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide some complexity considerations as well as cost estimations.</description></item><item><title>Neural Style Transfer</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/neural_style_transfer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/neural_style_transfer/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Neural Style Transfer, artifical neural networks are used to combine two images, such that the result has the content of one but the style of another image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I go through the basic concepts and mathematical formulatins and also provide a working codebase for you to try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A gallery with some of my proudest results is provided at the end :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mandelbrot images</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/mandelbrot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/mandelbrot/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post we look at the fampus mandelbrot set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I implemented it both in C++ and Python and provide some complexity considerations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I built dashboard that allows you to interactivelu explore the set and create beautiful animations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sudoku Solver</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/sudoko_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/sudoko_solver/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can use the Sudoku Solver whenever you are stuck on a puzzle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can read a playing field either directly via webcam or by uploading a picture and quicklu provide you with the solution.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
