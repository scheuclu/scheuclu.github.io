Is a collaborative GIF image board, where users can authenticate via their Solana wallet. The Solana blockchain is used as a database. The app is hosted decentralized on IPFS and ICP.</description></item><item><title>How to decieve using statistics</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/statistic_lies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/statistic_lies/</guid><description>It always bothers me when people sell some percentages they calculated somehow as &amp;lsquo;statistics&amp;rsquo;, particularly in the media.
Thus, I would like this post to be a quick introduction, based on examples, on how manipluative some badly done statistics can be.</description></item><item><title>EU Covid certificate decoder</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/eu_covid_certificate_decoder/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/eu_covid_certificate_decoder/</guid><description>A small little webtool that allows you to read out the information stored in your EU Covid certificate (Green Pass).</description></item><item><title>Password Hash Cracking</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/password_hash_cracking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/password_hash_cracking/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m taking a look how user-authentifications works.&lt;br>
We will dive a bit into hash functions&lt;br>
Finally, we try to recover passwords from leaked hashes using GPUs.&lt;br>
Addittionally, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide some complexity considerations as well as cost estimations.</description></item><item><title>Neural Style Transfer</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/neural_style_transfer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/neural_style_transfer/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Neural Style Transfer, artifical neural networks are used to combine two images, such that the result has the content of one but the style of another image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I go through the basic concepts and mathematical formulatins and also provide a working codebase for you to try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A gallery with some of my proudest results is provided at the end :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mandelbrot images</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/mandelbrot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/mandelbrot/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post we look at the fampus mandelbrot set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I implemented it both in C++ and Python and provide some complexity considerations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goals is to implement a fully working calculator, without using any of the standard libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The calculator is able to accept arbitrary string that represent and expression or equation and solve it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sudoku Solver</title><link>https://scheuclu.com/posts/sudoko_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 15:01:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://scheuclu.com/posts/sudoko_solver/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can use the Sudoku Solver whenever you are stuck on a puzzle.&lt;/p>
