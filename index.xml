Notably, I wanted to do it without the use of any sophisticated libraries.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the feature specification:
Infix and Reverse Polish notation are supported. Parentheses are supported. Basic arithmatic as well as trigonometric functions are supported. Supports basic constants such as Eulers number or Pi. The calculator can solve for one unknown in a linear equation.</description></item></channel></rss>
